# D's Implementation of Gopherexercise 2

### Setup
In this directory, run:

```
go run main/main.go
```

Getting started on this exercise was harder than getting started on the previous one. 
You had to first clone your own copy of the main directory into a sub directory in 
the students folder, then change the import function in main.go from "github.com/gophexercises/urlshort" to
"urlshort", then finally run the following command on the command line

```
go mod init urlshort 
```

After these steps, I could then run main.go.
